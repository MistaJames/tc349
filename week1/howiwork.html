<h2>Who are you? And what do you do?</h2>
<p>I'm James Tennant, and I'm a graphic designer. These past couple days, I have started working with Git and GibHub. I do a lot of things, ranging from web development to drawing.</p>
<p>Drawing has been a talent of mine since I was young. It is that talent that lead me to other fields such as graphic design and multimedia</p>
<h2>What hardware do you use?</h2>
<p>I am more of a PC person, but I also work with Mac from time to time depending on my situation. Recently, I find myself working on a laptop, but even then, I am more comfortable working on a desktop. I guess it has something to do with spending more time with that through most of my life than I am with the laptop. No doubt, the laptop has been very convenient whenever I'm taking notes or doing other stuff while I'm away from home.</p>
<h2>And what software?</h2>
<p>When it comes to web design, I have grown accustomed to using Dreamweaver. With it, I am able to do multiple things, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery. However, I have had my share of experiencing other tools, including Notepad++. I hope to grow accustomed to new programs (e.g. Git and GitHub) over time.</p>
<h2>What would be your dream setup?</h2>
<p>Probably an up to date desktop PC, with a higher performance processor and graphic card. I also wanted to try out a tablet PC, or an iPad to do digital art with.</p></div>
